# Near Earth Asteroid Dashboard

The Near Earth Asteroid Dashboard is built in React, Flux, and Hapi.

#### Quick Start

First, ensure you have [Node.js version 4](https://nodejs.org/dist/v4.2.2/node-v4.2.2.pkg) installed.

Second, pick up a [NASA API key](https://api.nasa.gov/index.html#apply-for-an-api-key).

Then, open a new terminal session, and run the following commands:

```bash
# cd into the directory
cd near-earth-asteroids

# Install the Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build the client assets
npm run build

# Start the app
npm start
```

Afterwards, the app should be available at http://localhost:8000.
